# Lost Your Job? Laugh, Cry, Then Conquer It ! Here’s How to Bounce Back Stronger!

## Introduction

Layoffs can be a devastating experience, and I know how it feels like.`Every time someone said, "I know how it feels," I internally wanted to grab their collar and ask, "How do you know how I feel?"` Trust me, I didn't feel it during the first 3 rounds of RIF (Reduction in Force) but felt it on the fourth round when I was part of that. So, I have (at least in my mind) all rights to say how, ***I feel it from my personal experience***.

When I was laid off, I felt a mix of shock, fear, betrayal, and uncertainty. But through this challenging time, I learned a lot about resilience, self-care, and the importance of support systems. 

Don't’ have medium subscription, I have you covered, hear is the link.

Even if, I say I am not going to share any tips, I will because you are here for that. I will try my best to share insights and tips on handling stress, managing emotions, staying financially afloat, keeping up with your routine, networking, and dealing with visa issues. I hope this will help you navigate these challenging times. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are ways to come out stronger on the other side. Let's walk through this journey together, step by step.

## Handling Stress

### Acknowledge Your Feelings

When I was laid off, I felt a whirlwind of emotions—shock, anger, sadness. I learned that the first step is to acknowledge these feelings. It's okay to feel this way; it's a natural response to a significant change. And you don't have a magic wand to time travel in past to do things differently nor are you in a position to change the decision. Acknowledge the fact this will at least help you and your mind to cool down and only then you can think of anything.

### Is Self-Care important now?

Yes, it's very important, in fact, its most important now. Because it helps to manage the intense stress and prevent burnout. Engaging in self-care activities allows you to recharge emotionally and physically, which is essential for maintaining a positive outlook and staying resilient during this challenging period.

When I say self-care, it isn't just about dealing with distraction; it is about healing. For me, taking long walks and practicing yoga, and mediation became my go-to stress relievers. Find what works for you—whether it's reading, cooking, or even just watching a favorite show.

The goal is to help you clear your mind and center yourself, giving you more strength to tackle each new day with confidence. Seeking professional help would be the right thing, but given the context, it depends on individual financial situations.

## Dealing with Emotions: Mind Over Matter

### Accepting It's Not Your Fault

When I first got the news of my layoff, the initial shock quickly turned into a whirlwind of emotions. One of the hardest things for me was **accepting** *the fact that the layoff wasn't my fault*. I remember sitting at my office desk, staring at my monitor, feeling a mix of numbness and disbelief. I spent many hours, questioning my abilities and self-worth. It took time, but gradually, I realized that these things happen. Layoffs are often more about the company's circumstances than personal performance. Coming to terms with this fact helped me start to let go of the guilt and self-doubt. It was a slow process, filled with moments of doubt, but eventually, I learned to forgive myself and understand that my value wasn’t tied to my job; *people still call me by my name, not by my job title*.

### Staying Positive

Staying positive was another significant challenge. In those early days, it felt almost impossible to find a silver lining. Every morning felt like a struggle to get out of bed. But I had to force myself to look for positives, no matter how small. After many motivational speeches, I started to see this unexpected time off as a rare opportunity to rethink my career path. Perhaps this was the perfect moment to explore new opportunities, something I hadn't dared to consider while I was comfortably employed. I started journaling, writing down every possible direction my career could take, out of the infinite possibilities, from starting my own business to day trading, crypto mining or lecturing, etc. All those were good bookies fantasies, but I was running against time (have very limited time), as I was on an H1B visa (more on this further). All the journaling had to be set aside, and I had to get a job immediately, and that can happen only with the thing that I am best at `Software Development`.

## Connect & Support System

When you’re going through a bad time in your career, you may feel isolated, but know that almost everyone will go through tough times in their work. In fact, 40% of people report they’ve lost a job at least once, and 23% say they’ve lost a job thee or more times. All of this is according to a survey from [Intoo and the Harris Poll.](https://resources.intoo.com/guides/layoff-anxiety-study?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=) And I am not trying to normalize Layoffs’ (RIF’s), the fact is that layoffs happen to many people, and they surpass them. So did I, and so will you.

During this tough time, my **support system** became my lifeline. I leaned heavily on my family and friends. Their unwavering belief in me was a constant reminder of my strengths. One statement that I heard a lot was, "***I know you've got this.**”, “**You will get job anywhere you want.***". `Even after knowing that I am applying for 30-40 jobs a day, but not even getting an interview call.`They listened to my worries, offered practical advice, and, most importantly, they encouraged me to keep going. Having people who care about you and can remind you of your worth, is invaluable when you're dealing with the emotional fallout of a layoff. They were the ones who helped me see that this setback was just a detour, not the end of the road. Their support was the emotional anchor that kept me steady.

## Networking: My Secret Weapon

### Rebuilding Professional Connections

When I first began the daunting task of rebuilding my professional network, I felt a mix of anxiety and reluctance. Reaching out to former colleagues and mentors was intimidating. I worried about what they might think of my situation. But I pushed through those fears and started sending messages and making calls. It took me 12 days to come out of it and post on LinkedIn about my layoff. To my surprise, many of them were incredibly supportive and helpful. They not only sympathized with my situation but also offered valuable advice and most importantly ***provide me with referrals***. Many of them even put me in touch with a hiring managers who was looking for someone with my skill set, which eventually started my interview journey.

### Leveraging Social Media

Updating my LinkedIn profile and leveraging social media also played a significant role. I spent time crafting my profile to highlight my skills and experiences, ensuring it accurately reflected my professional journey accurately. Actively reaching out to people who had messaged me about roles in the past also helper. Through these online interactions, I discovered several new opportunities that I wouldn't have come across otherwise. One particularly memorable moment was when many of my former colleague I hadn't spoken to in years reached out with a job lead after seeing my post about looking for new opportunities.

Attending industry events would have been another crucial step, but being in Tampa, FL, I didn't have many options.

## Dealing with Finances

Thankfully, I had an emergency fund for 6+ months, but there were many new things that needs to be done on a winter day when compared to a bright sunny day. Identifying and creating a strict budget was essential, when you are the sole provider for your family with kids. Identifying my basic expenses, was a must. I listed out my expenses and found areas to cut back. It was tough but necessary.

If any of these things don't make sense to you now, know that “during winter, you only need food and shelter to survive.” Don’t try to fix everything now. But keep emergency fund, budgeting, and finances as a top priority item the moment you see the sun. As most people do, I am also throwing a disclaimer: “*I am not a Financial Advisor; seek a Financial Advisor to walk you through your situation.*”

## Keeping Up with Your Schedule

When the routine of a 9-to-5 job suddenly disappears, it can feel like you're adrift in a sea of endless possibilities—and not in a good way. Without a schedule, the things in my mind were ***what went wrong***, ***why didn't I see it coming, what could I have done differently,*** bla.. bla… But trust me, maintaining a structured schedule is your life raft. Here’s how I managed to stay anchored:

### Daily Routine: Your New Best Friend

Imagine waking up every day with a sense of purpose, even when you don't have a job to go to. Establishing a daily routine was my secret weapon. I set a consistent wake-up time, made my bed, dressed as if I had somewhere to be, drop you kid to school (while driving, maintaining the same sense of urgency). This simple act of normalcy provided a much-needed sense of stability.

**Pro tip:** Keep a planner or use a digital calendar to map out your day. Plan your exercise times, job search slots, job preparation slot, interview slots and even breaks. It gives you something to look forward to and helps prevent the dreaded slump.

## Job Search: A Full-Time Job

I approached my job search like it was a job itself. I allocated specific hours of the day solely for job hunting and improving my resume. This wasn't just about sending out applications; it was about refining my LinkedIn profile, researching companies, and preparing for interviews. I dedicated my mornings to this task when my mind was fresh. Setting these boundaries helped me avoid burnout and maintain a balanced life. Remember, quality over quantity: `tailor your applications to each job to increase your chances` it's very important and you will see a difference.

### Skill Development: The Silver Lining

Here’s the thing about unexpected time off—it can be an opportunity in disguise. I took online courses and tried for certifications (but couldn’t complete one) that will boot resume, also kept my skills sharp. Websites like Coursera, Udemy, and You tube offer courses in almost every field imaginable. Not only did this make me more marketable, but it also kept me engaged and motivated. Plus, learning something new can be a great confidence booster. There was a balance that needs to be sticked when it comes to learning new vs brushing up from your experience.

**Pro tip:** See how many jobs you currently have with the tech stack. If you have enough (this is subjective), then brushing up should take precedence over learning new. In my case it was 70% on brushing up and 30% on learning new.

## Keeping up with Visa Status

If you’re here, chances are you’re dealing with the nerve-wracking experience of being laid off while on an H1B visa. First of all, take a deep breath. You’re not alone, and you have options. Let’s dive into a survival guide that’s packed with practical advice, sprinkled with humor, and a dash of encouragement to help you navigate these choppy waters.

### Understand Your Options: Knowledge is Power

Alright, so you got the news. It’s like that moment in the movie when the hero gets knocked down but is about to rise again. The first thing you need to do is understand your options. Research thoroughly – like you’re cramming for the most important exam of your life.

- **60-Day Grace Period**: After multiple interactions with legal advisers, my understanding is, “You have to ***find a new job*** within 60 days is a myth, The reality is you have to ***start new job*** or change your visa status. This window is your lifeline (you only get 60 days grace period in lifetime), so use it wisely.
- **Change of Status**: If finding a new employer seems tough, consider changing your visa status.
    - Can you go back to school?
    - Maybe an H4 visa if your spouse is also on an H1B?
    - Status change to a B1/B2 visa.

**Pro Tip**: Some law firms offer free initial consultations. It’s worth shopping around to find a lawyer who fits your needs and budget.

### Legal Advice: Your Best Friend in Legal Armor

Imagine you’re venturing into unknown territory. Would you go without a map? Nope. That’s where an immigration lawyer comes in. They are your Gandalf in the legal labyrinth.

- **Clarifying Confusion**: They help demystify the legal jargon and guide you through your rights and options.
- **Strategizing**: A lawyer can help strategize your next steps, whether it’s finding a new employer or changing your visa status.

**Pro Tip**: Some law firms offer free initial consultations. It’s worth shopping around to find a lawyer who fits your needs and budget.

### Proactive Communication: Honesty is the Best Policy

When it comes to job hunting, honesty about your visa status is crucial. It might feel like you’re laying all your cards on the table, but trust me, it’s better than surprises down the line.

- **Upfront Discussions**: Be upfront about your visa status during interviews. Employers appreciate honesty, and it saves everyone time.
- **Documentation**: Keep all your documents ready. Employers will need these to start the transfer process quickly.

**Humor Break**: Imagine going on a date and not mentioning you’re a vampire until the third date. Awkward, right? Same goes for visa status. Better to be upfront!

## Conclusion

Going through a layoff was one of the toughest times in my life, but it also taught me resilience and adaptability. By managing stress, dealing with emotions, staying financially savvy, keeping a routine, networking, and handling visa issues, I found my way through.

There were days filled with doubt and uncertainty, but amidst the challenges, there were also moments of triumph and hope. Receiving offers from major companies like Meta, Amazon, Oracle, and Geico was a significant validation of my skills and perseverance. These opportunities reassured me that ***even in the darkest times, there’s always a glimmer of hope.***

I know firsthand how overwhelming the journey can be, especially when facing a layoff while on an H1B visa. But remember, each setback is a setup for a comeback. The countless hours spent on preparation, the emotional rollercoaster, and the unwavering support from loved ones all contribute to your strength.
