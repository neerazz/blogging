**Seamlessly Upgrading Your Spring Boot Application: A Journey from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.0**

# Description:

Greetings, fellow developers! Today, we embark on a fascinating expedition, shedding light on the process of migrating from Spring Boot 2.x to the shiny new Spring Boot 3.0. As we delve into the depths of this migration, we'll unearth the multitude of advantages this transition offers and how to navigate the breaking changes that come with it.

Before we dive in, let's set the stage. Spring Boot, a project built on top of the Spring Framework, is a game-changer in the Java ecosystem. It provides a simplified approach to developing stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications, reducing much of the boilerplate code and configuration that Spring traditionally required. In essence, it allows us to focus more on our business logic, rather than the setup and configuration of the application.

Now, if you're here, I presume you're already familiar with Spring Boot 2.x and its magic. But why should you consider migrating to Spring Boot 3.0? Well, let's uncover some of its irresistible advantages:

1. **Java 17 LTS Support**: Spring Boot 3.0 offers seamless compatibility with Java 17, the latest long-term support (LTS) Java version. This means you can leverage all the new features and improvements that come with Java 17.
2. **Improved Configuration Property Management**: With some property keys having been modified, and deprecated ones removed, managing configuration properties becomes more intuitive and standardized.
3. **Jakarta EE 10 Support**: Spring Boot 3.0 incorporates the latest version of Jakarta EE, bringing updates to several related dependencies and specifications.
4. **Hibernate Updates**: If your application uses Hibernate, Spring Boot 3.0 ensures that you're utilizing the most up-to-date version of this popular Java persistence framework.
5. **Enhanced Logging Capabilities**: The new default date format for logging in Spring Boot 3.0 provides more detailed and easily readable log entries.
6. **Streamlined Constructor Binding**: Spring Boot 3.0 simplifies the way we bind properties to our beans, requiring `@ConstructorBinding` only at the constructor level.
7. **Path Matching Configuration**: The option to configure trailing slash matching has been deprecated, leading to cleaner URL patterns in your Spring Boot application.
8. **Removal of Legacy Processing**: Spring Boot 3.0 removes legacy processing support, paving the way for more modern and efficient configuration file loading.
9. **End of Image Banner Support**: While this may seem minor, the removal of image banner support in Spring Boot 3.0 encourages a more text-focused, accessible approach for custom banners.
10. **Up-to-Date Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.0 ensures you're working with the latest versions of all its dependencies, keeping your application secure and leveraging the most efficient and feature-rich tools available.

With these tempting benefits in mind, it's time we roll up our sleeves and dive into the nitty-gritty of the migration process. From @Entity migration to Spring Security changes, and even changes in Spring Sleuth, our journey will lead us through the wild landscape of Spring Boot 3.0's breaking changes. Let's get started!

# **Detailed:**

## **1. Java 17 LTS Support**

Spring Boot 3.0 requires Java 17, which is the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Java. This requirement means that your application will benefit from the latest language features, security updates, and performance improvements that come with Java 17.

To prepare for this, you need to upgrade your application to use Java 17 and ensure that your build tools (Maven or Gradle) are compatible with Java 17. For Gradle, you need version 7.5 or later, and for Maven, you need version 3.6.3 or later.

**Gradle Application**

In your `build.gradle` file, you need to make the following changes:

1. Update the Spring Boot plugin version to 3.0.6 (or the latest Spring Boot 3.0.x version at the time you're doing the upgrade):

```
plugins {    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.0.6'    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.11.RELEASE'    id 'java'}
```

1. Set the Java source and target compatibility to Java 17:

```
java {    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

1. Verify that your Gradle version is compatible with Java 17. As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, Gradle 7.x supports Java 17. If your Gradle version is older, you might need to upgrade it.
2. Make sure you have JDK 17 installed on your machine and your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the correct path. You can check your Java version by running the command `java -version` in your terminal.

**Maven Application**

In your `pom.xml` file, do the following:

1. Update the Spring Boot parent version to 3.0.6 (or the latest Spring Boot 3.0.x version at the time you're doing the upgrade):

```
<parent>    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>    <version>3.0.6</version></parent>
```

1. Set the Java version to 17:

```
<properties>    <java.version>17</java.version></properties>
```

1. Verify that your Maven version is compatible with Java 17. As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, Maven 3.8.1 supports Java 17. If your Maven version is older, you might need to upgrade it.
2. As with Gradle, ensure you have JDK 17 installed and your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly.

After making these changes, you should be able to use Java 17 features in your Spring Boot application, ensuring it's ready for Spring Boot 3.0.

## **2. Improved Configuration Property Management**

Spring Boot 3.0 includes a number of improvements to configuration property management, making it easier to manage and use configuration properties in your applications.

### **Some property keys have been modified**

In some cases, property keys have been modified in Spring Boot 3.0 to improve clarity or consistency. Here are some examples:

- The `server.port` property has been renamed to `server.http.port` to make it clear that this property is used to configure the HTTP port of your application.
- `spring.redis` has moved to `spring.data.redis`
- `spring.data.cassandra` has moved to `spring.cassandra`
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.use-new-id-generator` is removed
- `server.max.http.header.size` has moved to `server.max-http-request-header-size`
- `spring.security.saml2.relyingparty.registration.{id}.identity-provider` support is removed

A list of modified property keys can be found here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html#application-properties-changed

### **Deprecated property keys have been removed**

Some property keys have been deprecated in Spring Boot 3.0 and will be removed in a future version. For example, the `spring.profiles.active` property has been deprecated in favor of the `spring.profiles.include` property.

A list of deprecated property keys can be found here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html#application-properties-deprecated

### **Managing configuration properties becomes more intuitive and standardized**

The changes to configuration property keys in Spring Boot 3.0 make it easier to manage and use configuration properties in your applications. In addition, the Spring Boot team has worked to standardize the names of configuration properties, making it easier to find and use the properties you need.

In order to identify and handle deprecated and moved properties, Spring Boot provides a tool called `spring-boot-properties-migrator`. This is a dependency that generates a report at startup time, listing deprecated property names and temporarily migrating the properties at runtime.

Here's how you can include it in your project:

**Maven Application**

In your `pom.xml`, add the following dependency:

```
<dependency>    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>    <artifactId>spring-boot-properties-migrator</artifactId>    <scope>runtime</scope></dependency>
```

**Gradle Application**

In your `build.gradle`, add the following dependency:

```
dependencies {    runtimeOnly 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-properties-migrator'}
```

***Note**: Please note that this is a temporary measure for migration and should be removed once the property changes are handled in your codebase. Also, it's important to consult the updated Spring Boot 3 documentation for any specific properties relevant to your application.*
